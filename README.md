This is repository with my code for Advent of Code (www.adventofcode.com)

Folder structure starts with year, followed by task, followed by language.
My first language is R, so for "fast" part I'll be using R, therefore code can be bit messy, but should work.
Then there will be optional folders for Python, where more polished code will be present.
