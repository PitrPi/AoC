This is repository with my code for Advent of Code (www.adventofcode.com)

Folder structure starts with year, followed by task, followed by language (if solved with multiple languages).

I started doing AoC in R, as it was my "fast" language. But in time I switched to Python, so you can find solutions in either language.
